In this session, you'll take your first steps into the world of SQL querying with [Opteryx](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx). Whether youâ€™re a data science enthusiast, a professional looking to sharpen your SQL skills, or a student eager to dive into the basics of data manipulation, this lab is designed to provide you with a solid foundation.\n","\n","**What You Will Learn and Do:**\n","\n","- Start by installing the Opteryx package. We'll guide you through every step, ensuring that Opteryx is set up properly in your environment.\n","- Learn how to import the Opteryx library into your Python script or Jupyter notebook. This step is crucial for all subsequent operations with Opteryx.\n","- Discover how to craft and execute a straightforward SQL query. You'll get hands-on experience with the syntax and capabilities of Opteryx.\n","- Understand how to retrieve and display the results of your queries. Seeing the output will help you grasp the immediate impact of the queries you write.\n","\n","**Getting Started**\n","\n","Before jumping into the coding, make sure you have a Python environment ready for use. This can be a local setup on your computer or a cloud-based Jupyter notebook.
