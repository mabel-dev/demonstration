In this second lab, you'll expand your skills by learning how to query local data files using Opteryx. This session is designed to deepen your understanding of SQL querying and familiarize you with handling file-based datasets.\n","\n","**What You Will Learn and Do:**\n","\n","- We'll start by downloading a comprehensive dataset on Space Missions.\n","- Enhance your SQL skills by crafting queries that not only read from a local parquet file but also perform data aggregations to provide insightful results.\n","- Learn to display the aggregated data effectively, allowing you to see the practical results of your queries visually.\n","\n","For this lab, weâ€™ll use a dataset detailing Space Missions from 1957 to 2022, made available by Mysar Ahmad Bhat on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/space-missions/versions/1?resource=download). This dataset was published on 2022-08-10 under a Public Domain license.\n","\n","**Getting Started**\n","\n","Ensure that your Python environment is set up as you did in Lab 101.01. If you're using a new setup or have cleared your previous configuration, you might need to reinstall Opteryx. Remember, practical application is key in learning, so each step you redo reinforces your skills.\n","\n","**Take Off!**\n","\n","Grab your data file and letâ€™s dive into the world of space missions!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uRCcj_eygFry"},"source":["To ensure we have a local file to query, let's first download it.
