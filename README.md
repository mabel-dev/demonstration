# Opteryx Labs

Welcome to the Opteryx Labs! These hands-on labs are designed to guide you from the fundamentals of SQL querying to mastering complex data operations with Opteryx. Whether you’re a data science enthusiast, a software developer, or a seasoned data analyst, these labs will enhance your data manipulation skills and expand your understanding of data querying.

## Overview

The Opteryx Labs series offers a structured approach to learning how to effectively use Opteryx for executing SQL queries across various data scenarios. Each lab builds on the last, increasing in complexity and introducing more advanced techniques.

- **Lab 101.01 - Simple Query & Display**: Dive into the world of Opteryx with a straightforward SQL query. This introductory lab will teach you how to execute a simple SQL query and visually display the results, setting a solid foundation for more complex operations.
  
- **Lab 101.02 - Query a Local File**: Expand your skills by querying data directly from local files. This lab will guide you through setting up and executing an SQL query against a Parquet file, enhancing your ability to handle file-based data sources.
  
- **Lab 101.03 - Draw a Simple Chart**: Learn to combine SQL querying with data visualization. In this lab, you will use results from Opteryx queries to create a basic chart using Matplotlib, illustrating the power of integrating SQL results with Python's data visualization capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of these labs, ensure you have a Python environment set up with Opteryx installed.
